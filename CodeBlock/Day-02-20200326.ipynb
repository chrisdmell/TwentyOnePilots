    "Practical Applications of [Market Basket Analysis](https://webfocusinfocenter.informationbuilders.com/wfappent/TLs/TL_rstat/source/marketbasket49.htm)\n",
    "\n",
    "When one hears Market Basket Analysis, one thinks of shopping carts and supermarket shoppers. It is important to realize that there are many other areas in which Market Basket Analysis can be applied. An example of Market Basket Analysis for a majority of Internet users is a list of potentially interesting products for Amazon. Amazon informs the customer that people who bought the item being purchased by them, also reviewed or bought another list of items. A list of applications of Market Basket Analysis in various industries is listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Retail. In Retail, Market Basket Analysis can help determine what items are purchased together, purchased sequentially, and purchased by season. This can assist retailers to determine product placement and promotion optimization (for instance, combining product incentives). Does it make sense to sell soda and chips or soda and crackers?\n",
    "Telecommunications. In Telecommunications, where high churn rates continue to be a growing concern, Market Basket Analysis can be used to determine what services are being utilized and what packages customers are purchasing. They can use that knowledge to direct marketing efforts at customers who are more likely to follow the same path.\n",
    "For instance, Telecommunications these days is also offering TV and Internet. Creating bundles for purchases can be determined from an analysis of what customers purchase, thereby giving the company an idea of how to price the bundles. This analysis might also lead to determining the capacity requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Banks. In Financial (banking for instance), Market Basket Analysis can be used to analyze credit card purchases of customers to build profiles for fraud detection purposes and cross-selling opportunities.\n",
    "Insurance. In Insurance, Market Basket Analysis can be used to build profiles to detect medical insurance claim fraud. By building profiles of claims, you are able to then use the profiles to determine if more than 1 claim belongs to a particular claimee within a specified period of time.\n",
    "Medical. In Healthcare or Medical, Market Basket Analysis can be used for comorbid conditions and symptom analysis, with which a profile of illness can be better identified. It can also be used to reveal biologically relevant associations between different genes or between environmental effects and gene expression.\n",
